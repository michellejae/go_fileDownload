- need to figure out how to do a range request grabbing each specific range 
    for example if my file is 100 bytes .. my first go routine will be 0-25, next one 26-30, and so on

- the above will be in go routines
- then need to save each specified chunk i download to a new file in order
- finally compared ETag signature

- need to reorganize code
- add context timeout
